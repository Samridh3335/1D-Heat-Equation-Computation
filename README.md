# 1D-Heat-Equation-Computation
MATLAB code is iterated to compute the behavior of one dimensional heat equation using implicit and explicit iteration schemes for the given boundary conditions. The cases computed for the analysis are as follows:

Case 1: - T(x,t=0) = 20
        - T(x=0,t) = 20
        - T(x=1,t) = 100
        - alpha    = 1

Case 2: - T(x,t=0) = 6*sin(pi*x/L)
        - T(x=0,t) = 0
        - T(x=1,t) = 0
        - alpha    = 1
